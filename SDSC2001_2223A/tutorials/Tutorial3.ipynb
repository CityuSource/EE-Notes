    "There are five exercises in total, which are designed based on Lecture 3. In each exercise, there are two parts, namely, Part I and Part II. I will mainly walk you through Part I of each exercise during the tutorial session on Friday (Sep. 16th, from 11:00 am to 11:50 am). Part II may be a bit more challenging than Part I for the beginners. So, Part II is mainly targeted on those who want to explore more. During the tutorial, you will be first given a few minutes, e.g., 3 min, to read and think of the questions. Then, I will explain each line of code in detail. After the tutorial, I still recommend you try Part II on your own, discuss with your classmates, or use google to search for the relevant solutions. Yet, if you do not want to work on Part II. It is perfectly fine. Finally, if you have any questions, feel free to contact me via email or approach me during the TA office hours."
