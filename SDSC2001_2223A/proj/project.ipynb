    "## Course Project\n",
    "\n",
    "**Instructions:** <br>\n",
    "a. In the course project, you will analyze a real-world dataset on housing sale price prediction. You will write a report on your data analysis using Jupyter Notebook. <br>\n",
    "b. For each step, make sure to explain what you are doing, annotate your results, and provide your interpretation. <br>\n",
    "c. When you finish, make sure to use `Kernel` -> `Restart and Run All` to restart the kernel and rerun the entire notebook to generate the desired outputs, before submitting your project report. <br>\n",
    "d. Upload your .ipynb file to Canvas for grading. <br>\n",
    "e. All questions related to the course project shall be posted in the Discussions section on Canvas. <br>\n",
    "<br>\n",
    "\n",
    "**Policy:** <br>\n",
    "The course project is worth 25 points, counting towards 25% of the course final score. <br>\n",
    "\n",
    "Late submission, empty submission or no submission receives 0 point. Please note that in order to pass the course, at least 30% of the total score for the project must be obtained. In case of special circumstances, email the instructor directly ahead of time. "
